C is better as a structure oriented langug to CPP is nothing but C with classes .... 

but in reality it's Classes are nothing but pseudo structures ... nothing like of java and Python ... 

and TBH it's inheritance sucks ... specially the Multilevel inheritance as I can't do a method call in another class and 

then call  the method from that class reference ... as I have to redefine it every time !........

CPP sucks ... unless It's used like C ... then it's the best in evry regrads
